# Progress: EffectTS MCP Todo Server

## Current Status: Planning Complete ✅

### Completed Analysis
- [x] **Project Brief Analysis**: Comprehensive EffectTS modernization plan documented
- [x] **Current State Assessment**: 544-line monolithic MCP server analyzed
- [x] **Architecture Design**: Three-layer architecture (Domain/Infrastructure/Application) defined
- [x] **Technology Stack**: Effect migration plan established
- [x] **Memory Bank Setup**: Complete project documentation created

### Working Features (Current Implementation)
- [x] **MCP Server**: Functional Model Context Protocol server
- [x] **Todo CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete operations
- [x] **Filtering**: Status, priority, and tag-based filtering
- [x] **Statistics**: Comprehensive todo analytics
- [x] **Resources**: JSON data and summary resources
- [x] **Prompts**: Daily report and task prioritization templates
- [x] **Error Handling**: Basic try-catch error handling
- [x] **Validation**: Zod schema validation

### Architecture Decisions Made
- [x] **Domain Layer**: Business logic with Effect Schema
- [x] **Infrastructure Layer**: MCP server, storage, configuration
- [x] **Application Layer**: Request handling and orchestration
- [x] **Error Strategy**: Data.TaggedError for typed errors
- [x] **Dependency Injection**: Effect Layer system
- [x] **Schema Migration**: Zod → Effect Schema

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Foundation (Not Started)
- [ ] Install Effect dependencies
- [ ] Create basic directory structure
- [ ] Set up core domain models with Effect Schema
- [ ] Implement base error types
- [ ] Create repository interfaces

### Phase 2: Domain Layer (Not Started)
- [ ] Todo model with Effect Schema
- [ ] TodoService interface and implementation
- [ ] TodoRepository interface
- [ ] Memory-based repository implementation
- [ ] Business logic with typed errors

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer (Not Started)
- [ ] MCP server setup
- [ ] Tool handlers with Effect
- [ ] Resource handlers with Effect
- [ ] Prompt handlers with Effect
- [ ] Configuration management

### Phase 4: Application Layer (Not Started)
- [ ] Application service orchestration
- [ ] Dependency injection setup
- [ ] Error boundary implementation
- [ ] MCP SDK integration

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Not Started)
- [ ] Unit tests for domain layer
- [ ] Integration tests for MCP functionality
- [ ] Error handling validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Known Issues
- **Current**: No type safety in error handling
- **Current**: Monolithic structure makes testing difficult
- **Current**: Code duplication across similar operations
- **Current**: Manual error message construction

## Technical Debt
- **Zod Dependency**: Will be replaced with Effect Schema
- **Global State**: In-memory Map needs abstraction
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks need Effect transformation
- **Testing**: No test infrastructure currently

## Performance Baseline
- **Bundle Size**: Current implementation is lightweight
- **Memory Usage**: In-memory storage for todos
- **Response Time**: Fast for small datasets
- **Cold Start**: Minimal startup time

## Migration Strategy
1. **Parallel Development**: Build new architecture alongside existing
2. **Incremental Migration**: Move one layer at a time
3. **Feature Parity**: Maintain all existing functionality
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure MCP clients continue working

## Success Criteria Progress
- [ ] Type-safe error handling throughout
- [ ] Modular, testable architecture
- [ ] Maintained MCP compatibility
- [ ] Improved developer experience
- [ ] No performance regression

## Next Milestone
**Target**: Complete Phase 1 (Foundation)
**Deliverables**: Effect dependencies installed, basic structure created, core models defined
**Timeline**: Immediate next task after memory bank setup
