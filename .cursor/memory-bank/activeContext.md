# Active Context: EffectTS MCP Todo Server

## Current Work Focus
**Status**: Planning and initial setup phase
**Primary Task**: Modernizing existing MCP Todo Server with EffectTS

## Recent Analysis
- **Brief Review**: Comprehensive EffectTS modernization plan identified
- **Current State**: Working MCP server with 544-line monolithic structure
- **Architecture Gap**: Need to transition from imperative to functional approach
- **Dependencies**: Currently using Zod, need to migrate to Effect Schema

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Foundation Setup (Priority: High)
- [ ] Install Effect dependencies (effect, @effect/schema, @effect/platform)
- [ ] Create basic project structure with domain/infrastructure/application layers
- [ ] Set up initial Effect Schema for Todo model
- [ ] Create base error types using Data.TaggedError

### 2. Core Domain Implementation (Priority: High)
- [ ] Implement Todo schema with Effect Schema
- [ ] Create TodoRepository interface
- [ ] Implement TodoService with typed error handling
- [ ] Create memory-based repository implementation

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Extract MCP server setup to infrastructure layer
- [ ] Create tool handlers using Effect
- [ ] Implement resource handlers with Effect
- [ ] Set up prompt handlers

### 4. Application Layer (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create application service orchestration
- [ ] Implement dependency injection layers
- [ ] Set up proper error handling boundaries
- [ ] Integrate with MCP SDK

## Key Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Three-layer architecture (Domain, Infrastructure, Application)
- **Error Handling**: Use Effect's typed error system with Data.TaggedError
- **Validation**: Migrate from Zod to Effect Schema
- **Testing**: Use Effect's built-in testing utilities
- **Storage**: Continue with in-memory storage initially

## Important Patterns to Follow
- **Schema First**: Define Effect Schemas before implementing business logic
- **Pure Functions**: Keep domain logic pure with Effect
- **Dependency Injection**: Use Effect's Layer system for clean boundaries
- **Error Composition**: Compose errors using Effect's union types

## Critical Implementation Notes
- **MCP Compatibility**: Must maintain exact API compatibility
- **Error Messages**: Preserve user-friendly error messages from current implementation
- **Performance**: Effect's lazy evaluation should maintain or improve performance
- **Bundle Size**: Effect adds ~200KB but benefits outweigh costs

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All existing MCP tools continue to work
- [ ] Error handling is type-safe throughout
- [ ] Code is modular and testable
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Improved developer experience

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking MCP protocol compatibility
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain exact same MCP API surface
- **Risk**: Learning curve with Effect
  - **Mitigation**: Follow established patterns from brief
- **Risk**: Performance regression
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmark during development

## Next Action Required
Begin with foundation setup - install Effect dependencies and create basic project structure following the outlined architecture.
