# Product Context: MCP Todo Server

## Problem Statement
The existing MCP Todo Server, while functional, suffers from common issues in rapidly developed prototype code:
- **Error Handling**: Manual try-catch blocks with unclear error types
- **Testing Difficulty**: Tight coupling makes unit testing challenging
- **Maintenance Burden**: Single large file becomes harder to maintain as features grow
- **Type Safety**: Limited error type information in function signatures
- **Code Duplication**: Similar patterns repeated across operations

## Solution Vision
Transform the server into a modern, functional TypeScript application using EffectTS that provides:
- **Type-Safe Error Handling**: Explicit error types in function signatures
- **Composable Architecture**: Modular services that can be easily tested and maintained
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns with injectable services
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better IDE support and refactoring capabilities

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Migration**: No disruption to existing MCP client integrations
- **Feature Parity**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Better error messages and handling
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and integrations

## Business Value
- **Reduced Maintenance Cost**: Modular architecture reduces debugging time
- **Improved Developer Productivity**: Type safety catches errors at compile time
- **Better Testing Coverage**: Dependency injection enables comprehensive testing
- **Scalability**: Clean architecture supports future enhancements

## Target Users
- **AI Assistants**: Using MCP tools for todo management
- **Developers**: Extending or maintaining the server
- **End Users**: Benefiting from more reliable todo operations through AI interfaces
